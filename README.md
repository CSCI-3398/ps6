# Problem Set 6: Deep learning ASR

The problem set is contained within the Jupyter notebook, `ps6.ipynb`. You can complete this problem set on your own computer, assuming you have Python 8 installed and can install all the necessary libraries.

If you can't get it running on your own machine, you can use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). In that case, you'll need to upload the notebook `ps6_colab.ipynb` to Colab, and you can complete your work there.

The deliverable for this assignment, due on Wednesday, November 11, 11:59pm Boston time, is the Jupyter notebook.

**IMPORTANT:** For this assignment, we will need to see the output of all your code, but we will not have time to actually run your code since it could take several hours. I recommend that you do Kernel-> Restart and run all a few hours before the assignment is due so that all the code can run and complete before the deadline.
