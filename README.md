# Problem Set 6: Deep learning ASR

The problem set is contained within the Jupyter notebook, `ps6.ipynb`. You can complete this problem set on your own computer, but you will need to have Python 3.8 installed and be able to install all the necessary libraries. 

The deliverable for this assignment, due on Wednesday, November 11, 11:59pm Boston time, is the Jupyter notebook.

**IMPORTANT:** For this assignment, we will need to see the output of all your code, but we will not have time to actually run your code since it could take several hours. Before you turn in your notebook, do `Kernel-> Restart and run all`. Of course, make sure that you do this a few hours before the assignment is due so that all the code can run and complete before the deadline.
